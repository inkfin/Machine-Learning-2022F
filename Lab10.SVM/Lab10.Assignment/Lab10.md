1. Can SVM be used for unsupervised clustering or data dimension reduction? Why?

    No, it canâ€™t. SVM is supervised learning. 

2. What are the strengths of SVMs; when do they perform well?

    Strengths: when the dataset is small, SVM can solve the problem very fast and well, like the clustering. It performs well when there are limited data. 

3. What are the weaknesses of SVMs; when do they perform poorly?

    Weakness of SVMs includes being unreliable in large datasets and being unable to solve multi-classification problems. 

4. What makes SVMs a good candidate for the classification / regression problem, if

    you have enough knowledge about the data?

    It is very fast, instinctive, and explainable.
